# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started with my own VueJS todo app.

**Thoughts:** I am really not that good in JS, and a framework makes it even weirder to work with.

### Day 1: September 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched some Scrimba Tutorials on VueJS

**Thoughts:** It's hard to find a good measure between theory and practice, but I needed more theory before I could really start doing anything.

I really might need to revisit some JS later on. I know only the most basic syntax from SoloLearn, and the rest is just guessing/googling error messages. 

Scrimba is really cool. If you haven't tried it yet, you should.

### Day 2: September 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made progress with some advanced feauteres of the todo-app

**Thoughts:** 1h is quite a lot of time in general, but no time if you code. UsuallynI code for hours on end, but only once to twice a week.

### Day 3: September 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Basically finished my to-do-app

**Thoughts:** Propably will start a new app tomorrow (maybe a calculator). Learnt many new things. I should stop writing this messages like anyone but me will read them. Why am I even writing them in English?
