# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started with my own VueJS todo app.

**Thoughts:** I am really not that good in JS, and a framework makes it even weirder to work with.

### Day 1: September 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched some Scrimba Tutorials on VueJS

**Thoughts:** It's hard to find a good measure between theory and practice, but I needed more theory before I could really start doing anything.

I really might need to revisit some JS later on. I know only the most basic syntax from SoloLearn, and the rest is just guessing/googling error messages. 

Scrimba is really cool. If you haven't tried it yet, you should.

### Day 2: September 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made progress with some advanced feauteres of the todo-app

**Thoughts:** 1h is quite a lot of time in general, but no time if you code. UsuallynI code for hours on end, but only once to twice a week.

### Day 3: September 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Basically finished my to-do-app

**Thoughts:** Propably will start a new app tomorrow (maybe a calculator). Learnt many new things. I should stop writing this messages like anyone but me will read them. Why am I even writing them in English?

### Day 4: September 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a bitcoin price displaying app using coindesks api (actually I just tried to make the API call work)

**Thoughts:** Working with async stuff is hard. Especially if you never did it before. I haven't. I feel creative for not doing the same thing with this one movie db, like everyone else (though btc is basically API project #2).  


### Day 5: September 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: The Bitcoin-App is now basically the MVP

**Thoughts:** Today, I learnt that you shouldn't trust any random tutorial on the internet. Trust W3-Schools instead :). Also, JavaScript is a weird language.


### Day 6: September 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Extended my BTC-App functionality

**Thoughts:** Stuff's hard. Only added a little feature in the whole hour and i had so much trouble with it.


### Day 7: September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS problem with my course change

**Thoughts:** I couldn't do anything yesterday and only half an hour today, because of school. i think I have to reduce the time per day to 30 minutes on work days.


### Day 7: September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went ahead and gave my app a layout and design

**Thoughts:** I hate CSS. It's a weird clusterf\*ck of ideas and concepts that dont work together.



### Day 8: September 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I think the app is ready.

**Thoughts:** You can really overoptimize everything. So I decided to just don't bother too much at all with optimization...

### Day 9: September 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: today I installed the vue-cli and created a project. Yes, that took me an hour.

**Thoughts:** There was a weird issue with installing node.js on ubuntu16.04, and I had to follow a guide and manipulate some weird files by hand. Felt good but was also scary.

creating a project with the CLI took like 2 minutes, and I wonder what the hard pat was. it seems like it only created some boilerplate.

Working wih the vue-cli is totally different from just including it via CDN. What is a .vue file? Why are there no .html/.css files? I was told "you should just start with the cdn version, it's easier to install", and i feel lied to.


### Day 10: September 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I mostly read about the (totally different) system with the .vue singe file component

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm getting the hang of it. It's actually way more handy and efficient, but still really different.

Also, it's two digits now. See you in 90 days to three digits (I will have to do 101 days to get to 100 cause I started at 0)

### Day 11: October 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: After I saw a tutorial for a full-stack webapp i became inspired and learned a bit express today.

**Thoughts:** I had to quit this challenge for some time. I was overly confident when starting this challenge right at the end of summer holiday, and of course school kicked in later. I'm not gonna lie, after I stopped doing this challenge, I got a bit lazy and didn't do it whenever possible, but the last year of high school is a bit harder, as one should probably expect. Now I'm using this extended weekend to start once again, this time hopefully for a little longer, but I'll probably cut the time to half an hour on weekdays, with the execption of friday, and sunday (meaning: half an hour on monday through thursday, 1 hour friday and saturday, 1/2 h on sunday).

See you hopefully tomorrow.


### Day 12: October 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working now on the front-wnd of my fullstack web app

**Thoughts:** Oops, I didn't really work on it. I actually made some little changes to the back-end saturday and some major stuff sunday, but not enough to commit it here. So now, I'm back at it again. But that's just life...



### Day 13: October 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made progress on the frontend. Learnt that you can't serve back- and front-end on different ports easily.

**Thoughts:** If you're reading this and are a future potential employer trying to find out whether I did eough open source work to be considered acceptable: see, I don't have a motivation problem, I even worked on mondays! If you're reading this and are not a potential employer, why are you even reading this?? Tell me! How? I don't know. If you're reading this, telepathy is hopefully already an option. Looking forward to thinking from you!
