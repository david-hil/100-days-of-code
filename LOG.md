# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started with my own VueJS todo app.

**Thoughts:** I am really not that good in JS, and a framework makes it even weirder to work with.

### Day 1: September 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Watched some Scrimba Tutorials on VueJS

**Thoughts:** It's hard to find a good measure between theory and practice, but I needed more theory before I could really start doing anything.

I really might need to revisit some JS later on. I know only the most basic syntax from SoloLearn, and the rest is just guessing/googling error messages. 

Scrimba is really cool. If you haven't tried it yet, you should.

### Day 2: September 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made progress with some advanced feauteres of the todo-app

**Thoughts:** 1h is quite a lot of time in general, but no time if you code. UsuallynI code for hours on end, but only once to twice a week.

### Day 3: September 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Basically finished my to-do-app

**Thoughts:** Propably will start a new app tomorrow (maybe a calculator). Learnt many new things. I should stop writing this messages like anyone but me will read them. Why am I even writing them in English?

### Day 4: September 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a bitcoin price displaying app using coindesks api (actually I just tried to make the API call work)

**Thoughts:** Working with async stuff is hard. Especially if you never did it before. I haven't. I feel creative for not doing the same thing with this one movie db, like everyone else (though btc is basically API project #2).  


### Day 5: September 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: The Bitcoin-App is now basically the MVP

**Thoughts:** Today, I learnt that you shouldn't trust any random tutorial on the internet. Trust W3-Schools instead :). Also, JavaScript is a weird language.


### Day 6: September 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Extended my BTC-App functionality

**Thoughts:** Stuff's hard. Only added a little feature in the whole hour and i had so much trouble with it.


### Day 7: September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS problem with my course change

**Thoughts:** I couldn't do anything yesterday and only half an hour today, because of school. i think I have to reduce the time per day to 30 minutes on work days.


### Day 7: September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went ahead and gave my app a layout and design

**Thoughts:** I hate CSS. It's a weird clusterf\*ck of ideas and concepts that dont work together.
